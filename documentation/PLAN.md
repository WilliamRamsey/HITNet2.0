# Plan

## Steps

### [ ] Build tracking and segmentation model on yolo v11

[https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/instance-segmentation-and-tracking/#samples]

### [ ] Real position generator

- Detect hash lines
- Find pixle distance between hashes at top and bottom
- Scale top of image foward until hash average is parallell. [https://medium.com/@joicejoseph/monitor-social-distancing-using-python-yolov5-opencv-78d72c675f5b]
- Use length of hashes to geometrically shift image to zero-perspective true square.
